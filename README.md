A simple TS tutorial from "The Net Ninja" channel in YT.

The app is a simple logger writen in TS and Vanilla JS. The purpose building this app was for fun and understanding basic TS. 

No npm has been used.

To run the application open the code in VSCode and initiate local server with the Go Live add-on (or similar). Then if needed choose the file "public" on your browser.

Enjoy!
